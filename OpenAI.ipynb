      "\n",
      "Biryani is a centuries-old aromatic rice dish that has captivated people across the globe with its exquisite taste and diverse range of flavors. A blend of spices, meat or vegetables, and long-grain basmati rice come together to create this delectable one-pot meal that is loved by millions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originating in the Indian subcontinent, biryani has since spread its wings to various parts of the world. Each region has put its own spin on the classic recipe, resulting in a multitude of variations like Hyderabadi biryani, Lucknowi biryani, Kolkata biryani, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "What sets biryani apart from other rice dishes is the unique method of preparation. The rice is often parboiled separately with whole spices like cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, and bay leaves to infuse it with an unmatched fragrance. Meanwhile, succulent pieces of marinated meat or an assortment of vegetables are cooked separately before being layered with the basmati rice in a large handi (a traditional cooking utensil) or pot. With every layer added comes another layer of flavor – saffron-infused milk for color and aroma or caramelized onions for depth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once all layers are assembled, the pot is sealed tightly either using dough or a cloth so that no steam can escape during cooking. This technique locks in all the flavors as well as ensures that each grain of rice remains separate and perfectly cooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end result? A mouth-watering blend of fragrant spices permeates throughout each spoonful while tender juicy meat (or veggies) provides bursts of flavor. The subtle sweetness from caramelized onions perfectly balances out any spiciness present in some variations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biryani has evolved over time to cater to different preferences and dietary requirements while retaining its essence – an explosion of flavors in every bite. For non-meat eaters, there are vegetarian biryanis packed with colorful vegetables and aromatic spices. Seafood lovers can indulge in the delightful taste of prawn or fish biryani. Chicken and mutton biryanis are the most popular, where succulent pieces of meat are cooked until tender and infused with spices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though traditionally served on special occasions or festive gatherings, nowadays, biryani is a favorite choice for casual dinners as well as take-out lunches. From humble street food stalls to high-end restaurants, each place has its own secret recipe that adds a unique touch to this beloved dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it's the rich flavors of Hyderabadi dum biryani or the fragrant aroma of Lucknowi nawabi biryani, this centuries-old dish continues to captivate food enthusiasts all over the world. Biryani is not just a meal – it's an experience that transports your taste buds on an unforgettable culinary journey.\n"

      "OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects that interact with each other. In Python, OOP allows you to create classes, which are like blueprints for creating objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Classes: A class is a template or blueprint that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of an object. It acts as a blueprint for creating multiple objects of the same type. For example, you can have a class called \"Car\" that defines the attributes like color, model, and methods like start_engine() and stop_engine().\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is a class in Python?\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Objects: An object is an instance of a class. It is created using the class as a blueprint. Each object has its own set of attributes and can perform actions defined by the class methods. For example, if you create two objects of the \"Car\" class, you can set different colors and models for each object.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is an object in Python?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Attributes: Attributes are the characteristics or properties of an object. They store data that describes the object's state. For example, a \"Car\" class may have attributes like color, model, and year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are attributes in Python?\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Methods: Methods are functions defined within a class that perform actions or operations on objects. They can access and modify the object's attributes. For example, a \"Car\" class may have methods like start_engine() and stop_engine().\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are methods in Python?\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. The class that inherits is called a subclass or derived class, and the class being inherited from is called a superclass or base class. This helps in code reusability and creating a hierarchy of classes. For example, you can have a \"SUV\" class that inherits from the \"Car\" class, inheriting its attributes and methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is inheritance in Python?\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal details of an object and providing access to only the necessary information. It helps in data protection and prevents direct access to an object's attributes. In Python, encapsulation can be achieved by using private attributes and methods, denoted by a leading underscore (_). For example, you can have a private attribute _speed that can only be accessed or modified through a method like set_speed().\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is encapsulation in Python?\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows methods to be overridden in the subclass, providing different implementations while using the same method name. This helps in code flexibility and extensibility. For example, you can have a superclass \"Animal\" with a method called make_sound(). The subclasses \"Dog\" and \"Cat\" can override this method to make different sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is polymorphism in Python?\n",
