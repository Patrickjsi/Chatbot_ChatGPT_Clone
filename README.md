## ChatGPT Clone Project
In this small project, I have created a clone of ChatGPT using the OpenAI API. The functionalities are similar to the free research preview available publicly.
Initialy, we need to provide a system prompt where we can define the nature of the chatbot (e.g., 'be concise', 'talk in German', etc.). Then we can have a general conversation.
When you feel like quitting the service, try saying 'exit', 'bye', or quit'.
