      "One popular Indian recipe that incorporates these common ingredients is Vegetable Biryani. Here's a simplified version of the recipe:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 cup basmati rice\n",
      "- 1 cup mixed vegetables (e.g., carrots, peas, beans)\n",
      "- 1 onion, sliced\n",
      "- 2 tomatoes, chopped\n",
      "- 3-4 cloves of garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated\n",
      "- 2 green chilies, slit\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon coriander powder\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala\n",
      "- Salt to taste\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons oil or ghee\n",
      "- Fresh coriander leaves for garnish\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for around 30 minutes, then drain and set aside.\n",
      "2. Heat oil or ghee in a large pan. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.\n",
      "3. Add sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown. Then, add minced garlic, grated ginger, and green chilies. Cook for another minute.\n",
      "4. Add chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, coriander powder, and salt. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and mushy.\n",
      "5. Add the mixed vegetables and cook for a few minutes until they are slightly tender.\n",
      "6. Add the soaked and drained basmati rice to the pan. Gently mix everything together.\n",
      "7. Pour water into the pan, using a 1:2 ratio of rice to water (for 1 cup of rice, use 2 cups of water).\n",
      "8. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pan with a lid, and let it simmer for around 15-20 minutes or until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed.\n",
      "9. Once done, remove the pan from heat and let it rest for a few minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork.\n",
      "10. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or pickle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: You can also add whole spices like cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves for additional flavor if desired. Adjust the spice levels according to your taste preferences.\n",
